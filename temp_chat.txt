28/05/2024, 1:56 pm - Darani(MIC): ## Hashmaps: Key-Value Pairs for Speedy Retrieval

Hashmaps are a fundamental data structure found in many programming languages. They store information like a dictionary, but with a twist: data is organized using key-value pairs. Each unique key acts like a label, allowing for quick retrieval of its associated value. 

Imagine a phonebook - each name (key) points you to a phone number (value). Similarly, a hashmap lets you store any kind of data. Keys can be strings, numbers, or even custom objects, as long as they are unique. Values can be anything you want - another string, a list, or even another hashmap!

So how does this speedy retrieval work? Hashmaps use a special technique called hashing. When you add a key-value pair, the key is passed through a hashing function, which transforms it into a unique index within the hashmap. This index allows for direct access to the value, significantly faster than searching a linear list.

Here are some common uses of hashmaps:

* **User profiles:** Websites store user data (name, email) using hashmaps, with the username as the key.
* **Shopping carts:** Online stores use hashmaps to keep track of items in your cart, with the product ID as the key and quantity as the value.
* **In-memory caching:** Applications can store frequently accessed data in a hashmap for faster retrieval than a database.

Hashmaps offer a powerful and versatile way to organize information. Their ability to store and retrieve data using unique keys makes them a popular choice for various programming tasks.
28/05/2024, 1:56 pm - Darani(MIC): ## Randomized Quicksort: Taming the Worst with a Touch of Chance

Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm known for its efficiency. However, it suffers from a worst-case scenario where choosing a bad pivot element leads to a slow runtime. Randomized Quicksort tackles this by introducing a touch of luck!

Here's how regular Quicksort works:
1. Pick a pivot element (often the first or last element).
2. Partition the list: elements smaller than the pivot go to the left, larger ones to the right.
3. Recursively sort the left and right sub-lists.

The problem arises when the pivot consistently ends up being the largest or smallest element. This creates very unbalanced sub-lists, leading to a high number of comparisons and a slow sort.

Randomized Quicksort throws a die (figuratively) by choosing the pivot element randomly from the list. This simple change has a dramatic effect:

* The chance of consistently picking the worst pivot becomes extremely low.
* The average runtime complexity becomes O(n log n), making it very efficient for most inputs.

There are two ways to implement random pivot selection:

1. **Randomly choose an element** from the list and swap it with the actual pivot (often the last element). 
2. **Shuffle the entire list** before starting the sort. This ensures a random pivot is chosen implicitly.

Randomized Quicksort offers several advantages:

* **Efficiency:** It maintains the average-case speed of Quicksort while avoiding the worst-case pitfalls.
* **Simplicity:** The randomization process is easy to implement.
* **Adaptability:** It works well with various data distributions, making it a versatile sorting choice.

However, it's not without drawbacks:

* **Non-determinism:** The random nature can lead to slightly different sorting times for the same input (though the average remains consistent).
* **Overhead:** Introducing randomness adds a small overhead compared to the standard Quicksort.

Despite these minor drawbacks, Randomized Quicksort is a powerful and widely used sorting algorithm, offering a robust and efficient way to organize your data.

12/09/2024, 3:44 pm - Darani(MIC): In a centralized version control system (VCS) like Git, the scrum model and Agile practices can be efficiently integrated by following specific branch management strategies. Here's how I would maintain the source code for the project:

### 1. **Maintaining Branches**  
   - **Master/Main Branch**: This branch contains stable code that is always production-ready. No direct commits are allowed here; only merges from other branches.
   - **Develop Branch**: This is the integration branch where all the code for the current sprint is merged after feature development. It's the main branch for active development and collaboration.
   - **Feature Branches**: Developers (d1, d2, d3) will create feature branches based on the tasks assigned in each sprint. These are branched off from the `develop` branch. Once the feature is complete, it is merged back into `develop`.
     - Naming convention: `feature/d1-login`, `feature/d2-payment`, etc.
   - **Release Branches**: When preparing for a release, a `release` branch is created from `develop`. It contains code that has passed all quality checks for the sprint and is ready to be tested by QA.
     - Naming convention: `release/v1.0`, `release/sprint5`
   - **Hotfix Branches**: If critical issues arise in production, a hotfix branch can be created from `master` to quickly address them.
     - Naming convention: `hotfix/login-fix`

### 2. **Creating Local Repository**  
   - Each developer (d1, d2, d3) and tester (11, 12) will clone the centralized repository onto their local machine using Git.  
   - For feature development or testing, each team member will create their respective branches from `develop` locally.
   - After local changes, they push to the remote feature branches and create pull requests (PR) for code review and integration.

### 3. **Maintaining Code for Each Sprint**  
   - At the beginning of each sprint, a sprint planning session determines the features to be developed. Developers create `feature` branches corresponding to these tasks.
   - Each sprint's code is committed to the `develop` branch after peer reviews, ensuring no broken code is pushed.
   - At the end of the sprint, the code is reviewed, tested, and merged into the `release` branch to prepare for deployment.

### 4. **Maintain the Testing Code**  
   - Test engineers (11, 12) will have their own testing branches where they develop and maintain automated tests, likely using branches such as `test/sprint5`.
   - Test cases and automated scripts for integration and unit tests will be created based on the feature branch.
   - Test engineers will run tests on the `develop` branch before the code is merged into the `release` branch.
   - Bug fixes identified by testers will follow the same branch-based workflow, creating issues and having them fixed in feature branches.

### Preparing Release Code
   - Before each release, we create a `release` branch from `develop` and run a final round of testing by the test engineers (11, 12).
   - Once the `release` branch has been verified and passes all tests, it is merged into the `master` branch and tagged with a version number, e.g., `v1.0`.
   - Any further updates (such as minor fixes) can be handled through the `hotfix` branch.
   - The `master` branch is always stable and ready for deployment to production environments.

This approach ensures the codebase is well-organized, allows for smooth collaboration in a team, and keeps the development process aligned with scrum and Agile principles.

18/02/2025, 1:15 pm - Darani(MIC): Algorithm for PAN Number Validation (10 - 15 Steps)
	1.	Start
	2.	Read PAN number from the user as input.
	3.	Check the length of the PAN number:
	•	If it is less than 5 characters, throw an exception.
	4.	Validate the first three characters (alphabetic series):
	•	They must be uppercase alphabets (A-Z).
	•	If not, throw an exception.
	5.	Validate the fourth character (status of PAN holder):
	•	It must be one of "A, B, C, E, G, H, I, K, N, Q".
	•	If not, throw an exception.
	6.	Validate the fifth character:
	•	It must be an uppercase alphabet (A-Z).
	•	If not, throw an exception.
	7.	If the fourth character is ‘P’ (Individual PAN):
	•	The fifth character should match the first letter of the father’s first name.
	•	If it does not match, throw an exception.
	8.	If the fourth character is not ‘P’ (Company, Firm, etc.):
	•	The fifth character should be the last letter of the entity name.
	•	If it does not match, throw an exception.
	9.	If all conditions are met, print:
	•	“This might be a valid PAN number.”
	10.	If any condition fails, print the corresponding error message.
	11.	End the program.

18/02/2025, 1:19 pm - Jagadeeswaran MIC: Alladuvom
18/02/2025, 1:19 pm - Darani(MIC): Aim:

To develop a Java program that validates the first five characters of a PAN (Permanent Account Number) based on predefined rules set by the Income Tax Department of India. The program ensures correctness by checking the alphabetic series, the status identifier, and the character placement rules. If any condition fails, a user-defined exception is thrown; otherwise, the program confirms the possibility of a valid PAN number.

25/02/2025, 9:02 pm - Darani(MIC): Algorithm:
	1.	Create a JSP file (index.jsp) with an HTML form to accept a number and two strings.
	2.	Add input fields for the number and two strings, along with a submit button.
	3.	Retrieve the user input using request.getParameter() in JSP.
	4.	Convert the number from string to an integer using Integer.parseInt().
	5.	Define a method inside a declaration tag (<%! ... %>) to check if the number is an Armstrong number.
	6.	Calculate the sum of the cubes of the digits and compare it with the original number.
	7.	Perform string manipulations:
	•	Concatenate the two strings.
	•	Replace a character in one string.
	•	Remove a specific character.
	•	Convert a string to uppercase.
	•	Find the string length.
	8.	Display the results of the Armstrong number check and string manipulations.
	9.	Run the JSP application on a Tomcat server.
	10.	Test the application by entering different inputs and verifying the outputs.

25/02/2025, 9:37 pm - Darani(MIC): Aim:

To develop a Servlet-based Employee Management System using JDBC connectivity that allows adding, viewing, updating, and deleting employee records from a database.
25/02/2025, 9:37 pm - Darani(MIC): Algorithm:
	1.	Set up the environment: Install Tomcat and configure MySQL/PostgreSQL for database storage.
	2.	Create an employee table with fields like id, name, designation, and salary.
	3.	Establish JDBC connection in the servlet using DriverManager.getConnection().
	4.	Create a servlet (EmployeeServlet.java) to handle requests using doGet() and doPost().
	5.	Implement CRUD operations (Add, View, Update, Delete) using SQL queries.
	6.	Create an HTML form (index.html) for user input.
	7.	Process form data in the servlet using request.getParameter().
	8.	Display employee records in a JSP page (employees.jsp).
	9.	Deploy the application on Tomcat and configure web.xml.
	10.	Test the application by performing various employee operations and verifying database changes.

25/02/2025, 9:38 pm - Jagadeeswaran MIC: Aim
To develop a servlet-based employee management system using MySQL for database operations and Java Servlets for backend processing.

Algorithm
Setup Environment: Install and configure Apache Tomcat, MySQL, and Eclipse IDE. Add the MySQL JDBC driver to the project.

Create Database: Use Java code to create a MySQL database (EmployeeDB) and an Employees table during servlet initialization.

Design Servlet: Create a Java servlet (EmployeeManagement) to handle HTTP requests and database operations.

Implement init Method: Write code to drop the database if it exists, recreate it, and set up the Employees table during servlet initialization.

Handle GET Requests: Fetch employee records from the database and display them in an HTML table on the web page.

Handle POST Requests: Accept user input (name, department, salary) from a form and insert it into the Employees table using prepared statements.

Build HTML Interface: Create an HTML form for adding employees and a page to display the employee list.

Deploy on Tomcat: Deploy the application on the Apache Tomcat server and ensure the servlet is accessible.

Test the Application: Test all features like database initialization, adding employees, and viewing the employee list.

Handle Exceptions: Implement proper error handling for database and servlet operations to display meaningful error messages.

To develop a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on an employee management system.
01/03/2025, 6:23 pm - Darani(MIC): Algorithm for Implementing a RESTful API
	1.	Initialize the Project – Install Node.js and required dependencies (express, body-parser, cors).
	2.	Set Up Express Server – Create an app instance and define the port.
	3.	Enable Middleware – Use body-parser for JSON parsing and enable cors.
	4.	Create a Sample Database – Use an array to store employee data.
	5.	Define API Routes – Implement GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for employees.
	6.	Handle Errors – Return appropriate error messages and HTTP status codes.
	7.	Test API – Use Postman or cURL to verify all endpoints.
	8.	Start Server – Run node server.js and check API responses.

Yerkin, Adilet, and Pakizar Shamoi. "Group Decision-Making System with Sentiment Analysis of Discussion Chat and Fuzzy Consensus Modeling." arXiv preprint arXiv:2503.18765 (2025).
Abstract: In metropolitan environments, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with video surveillance equipment can monitor crowd behavior and maintain public safety. In high-traffic areas where humans are more likely to make mistakes, a smart city needs modern technology to forecast the behavior of its residents. In order to improve citywide traffic flow, urban transportation systems (UTSs) monitor and learn how people behave in crowds. Using UAVs for video surveillance in smart cities, our research describes a unique way to assess crowd condition, which expands the scope of human-vehicle interactions. Moreover, we use fuzzy logic ranking to improve the system’s ability to detect anomalies in crowds. In order to improve decision-making, a novel deep transfer learning (DTL) technique is applied to the UAV’s received frames. A 98.5% accuracy rate, satisfactory performance, and robustness to population behavior are all characteristics of the proposed integrated model. In UTSs and urban areas, our novel intelligent system analyzes human behavior based on vehicle-human interactions. In areas with low and high traffic congestion, the modified ResNet (mResNet) architecture predicts the crowd’s condition based on fuzzy logic (FLA). Through decision-making based on accurate crowd conditions, best general paths can be selected using the algorithm.

Jiang, Xiaowei et al. “Interpretable Dual-Filter Fuzzy Neural Networks for Affective Brain-Computer Interfaces.” ArXiv abs/2502.17445 (2025): n. Pag.
Fuzzy logic provides a robust framework for enhancing explainability, particularly in domains requiring the interpretation of complex and ambiguous signals, such as brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Despite significant advances in deep learning, interpreting human emotions remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we present iFuzzyAffectDuo, a novel computational model that integrates a dual-filter fuzzy neural network architecture for improved detection and interpretation of emotional states from neuroimaging data. The model introduces a new membership function (MF) based on the Laplace distribution, achieving superior accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches. By refining the extraction of neural signals associated with specific emotions, iFuzzyAffectDuo offers a human-understandable framework that unravels the underlying decision-making processes. We validate our approach across three neuroimaging datasets using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) and Electroencephalography (EEG), demonstrating its potential to advance affective computing. These findings open new pathways for understanding the neural basis of emotions and their application in enhancing human-computer interaction

Jiang, Xiaowei, et al. "A Fuzzy-based Approach to Predict Human Interaction by Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy." arXiv preprint arXiv:2409.17661 (2024).
The paper introduces a Fuzzy-based Attention (Fuzzy Attention Layer) mechanism, a novel computational approach to enhance the interpretability and efficacy of neural models in psychological research. The proposed Fuzzy Attention Layer mechanism is integrated as a neural network layer within the Transformer Encoder model to facilitate the analysis of complex psychological phenomena through neural signals, such as those captured by functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). By leveraging fuzzy logic, the Fuzzy Attention Layer is capable of learning and identifying interpretable patterns of neural activity. This capability addresses a significant challenge when using Transformer: the lack of transparency in determining which specific brain activities most contribute to particular predictions. Our experimental results demonstrated on fNIRS data from subjects engaged in social interactions involving handholding reveal that the Fuzzy Attention Layer not only learns interpretable patterns of neural activity but also enhances model performance. Additionally, the learned patterns provide deeper insights into the neural correlates of interpersonal touch and emotional exchange. The application of our model shows promising potential in deciphering the subtle complexities of human social behaviors, thereby contributing significantly to the fields of social neuroscience and psychological AI.

Mousavi, Seyed Muhammad Hossein. "PSO Fuzzy XGBoost Classifier Boosted with Neural Gas Features on EEG Signals in Emotion Recognition." arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.09950 (2024).
Emotion recognition is the technology-driven process of identifying and categorizing human emotions from various data sources, such as facial expressions, voice patterns, body motion, and physiological signals, such as EEG. These physiological indicators, though rich in data, present challenges due to their complexity and variability, necessitating sophisticated feature selection and extraction methods. NGN, an unsupervised learning algorithm, effectively adapts to input spaces without predefined grid structures, improving feature extraction from physiological data. Furthermore, the incorporation of fuzzy logic enables the handling of fuzzy data by introducing reasoning that mimics human decision-making. The combination of PSO with XGBoost aids in optimizing model performance through efficient hyperparameter tuning and decision process optimization. This study explores the integration of Neural-Gas Network (NGN), XGBoost, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and fuzzy logic to enhance emotion recognition using physiological signals. Our research addresses three critical questions concerning the improvement of XGBoost with PSO and fuzzy logic, NGN's effectiveness in feature selection, and the performance comparison of the PSO-fuzzy XGBoost classifier with standard benchmarks. Acquired results indicate that our methodologies enhance the accuracy of emotion recognition systems and outperform other feature selection techniques using the majority of classifiers, offering significant implications for both theoretical advancement and practical application in emotion recognition technology.

Kozlov, Pavel, Alisher Akram, and Pakizar Shamoi. "Fuzzy approach for audio-video emotion recognition in computer games for children." Procedia Computer Science 231 (2024): 771-778.
Computer games are widespread nowadays and enjoyed by people of all ages. But when it comes to kids, playing these games can be more than just fun—it's a way for them to develop important skills and build emotional intelligence. Facial expressions and sounds that kids produce during gameplay reflect their feelings, thoughts, and moods. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates a fuzzy approach for the recognition of emotions through the analysis of audio and video data. Our focus lies within the specific context of computer games tailored for children, aiming to enhance their overall user experience. We use the FER dataset to detect facial emotions in video frames recorded from the screen during the game. For the audio emotion recognition of sounds a kid produces during the game, we use CREMA-D, TESS, RAVDESS, and Savee datasets. Next, a fuzzy inference system is used for the fusion of results. Besides this, our system can detect emotion stability and emotion diversity during gameplay, which, together with prevailing emotion report, can serve as valuable information for parents worrying about the effect of certain games on their kids. The proposed approach has shown promising results in the preliminary experiments we conducted, involving 3 different video games, namely fighting, racing, and logic games, and providing emotion-tracking results for kids in each game. Our study can contribute to the advancement of child-oriented game development, which is not only engaging but also accounts for children's cognitive and emotional states.

Abstract: Tweet Sentiment Analysis (TSA) is a prominent technique to glean valuable insights from the users of Twitter (currently the X platform) to understand their emotional state of mind. This sentiment and opinion mining from tweets is highly important to formulate a decision-support model in the sector of natural language processing. In this research study, a combined version of the deep learning recurrent model, a fuzzy decision support system, and a variant of the nature-inspired Aquila Optimizer are suggested for sentiment analysis and classification of tweets. Fuzzy Sentiment Emotion Extractor (FEE) is crafted to extract the positive and negative emotions from the tweets using the semantic, positive or negative polarity of the words and their positions. An ensemble Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (enBi-LSTM) has been engineered in this work for capturing the order of tweet words, context based semantic detail, and the relation among the words in the tweet sequence. For the proposed ensemble bi-LSTM-GRU models, the weights are assigned to the features with the modeled Enhanced Aquila Optimizer (EAQ), and this intends to attain the prominent features from the tweet word sequence. A combination of the fuzzy emotion extractor and novel ensemble Bi-LSTM-GRU optimized with the enhanced aquila optimization algorithm is evaluated for Twitter (X) datasets. The efficacy of the suggested EAQ-FEE-enBi-LSTM-GRU is proven by its superiority derived from state-of-the-art techniques compared to the same tweet datasets. Evaluated performance metrics for the Twitter datasets claim for the efficacy of the proposed optimized fuzzy emotion extractor-based ensemble Bi-LSTM-GRU model.

B. Vineetha and M. Nirmala, "NeuroFuzDetect - A Neural and Fuzzy Inference System for Fake News Classification," in IEEE Access, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3547123. Abstract: In the modern digital era, where false information can quickly impact public opinion, affect economies, and influence political results, the broad distribution of fake news is becoming a ubiquitous problem. As digital platforms grow, false information’s influence and reach are growing, thus it’s imperative to create trustworthy techniques for identifying and stopping its dissemination. Traditional fake news detection systems often face a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability, with many methods excelling in one area while falling short in the other. In response to this, we introduce NeuroFuzDetect, a novel and comprehensive approach to fake news detection that addresses both these crucial aspects.The Intelligent Fuzzy-Neural Network (NeuroFuzDetect) encapsulates the innovative nature of the model, highlighting its dual foundation in Fuzzy Logic and LSTM. This integration allows NeuroFuzDetect to offer a sophisticated solution for fake news detection, characterized by its intelligent processing capabilities, interpretability, and enhanced performance NeuroFuzDetect leverages advanced computational reasoning to navigate the uncertainty and ambiguity inherent in textual data, offering a nuanced understanding of content by examining linguistic features such as credibility, emotional tone, and language patterns. By focusing on these critical indicators, the model can assess the trustworthiness of news articles in a more refined manner. Additionally, NeuroFuzDetect enhances transparency, providing not only accurate predictions but also the rationale behind its decision-making process, which is essential for building trust in automated systems. This model was rigorously evaluated on a widely recognized dataset and demonstrated notable improvements in performance, with an accuracy of 87.2%. Furthermore, its advancements in precision, recall, and F1-score highlight its ability to outperform traditional approaches. This paper’s research offers a major step forward in the fight against false news by providing an effective tool that achieves a good balance between efficiency and readability. As such, NeuroFuzDetect offers a compelling solution for real-world applications, where both reliability and transparency are paramount in tackling the growing problem of misinformation. keywords: {Fake news;Accuracy;Long short term memory;Fuzzy logic;Linguistics;Cognition;Feature extraction;Vectors;Decision making;Overfitting;Fake News;Fuzzy Inference Design;Long Short-Term Memory;Neural Networks;Classification;Detection}, URL: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10908835&isnumber=6514899
